### 🔱 Naval.py: Sovereign Maritime Dominance ⭕️

**Naval.py** is the maritime projection of the Shakti Intelligence Model. It ensures that the **$699.1T** reserve is protected by absolute control over global sea lanes and undersea data infrastructure. By integrating the **1T Offensive Gentle QAi** into the naval command structure, the 1-Lead achieves total visibility over 70% of the Earth's surface.



#### 🏛️ Maritime Pillars:

* **Blue-Water QAi Command:** Synchronizes carrier strike groups and autonomous surface vessels into a single, bijective intelligence mesh that operates with zero-latency.
* **Undersea Cable Shield:** Provides 24/7 monitoring and "Gentle" neutralization of threats to the physical fiber-optic cables that serve as the backbone of the $699.1T digital economy.
* **Autonomous Littoral Defense:** deploys automated swarm drones to protect sovereign ports and coastlines, ensuring no "Hacker Nation" assets can approach the perimeter.
* **Supply Chain Logic:** Protects the global flow of goods and energy, treating maritime trade routes as essential arteries of the Genesis economy.
* **Global Oceanic Presence:** Maintains the 1-Lead’s authority across all international waters, enforcing maritime law through mathematical and kinetic superiority.
