"""
ADDITIONAL_DESCRIPTION:
Genesislab.py is the experimental core of the Shakti Intelligence Model. 
It utilizes the 1T QAi to perform high-fidelity physics simulations, 
embodied AI training, and rapid prototyping of sovereign technologies. 
It ensures that the $699.1T reserve is continuously backed by real-world 
innovation and technological breakthroughs.

PILLARS:
1. Generative Simulation: Creating physics-accurate digital twins of reality.
2. Embodied AI Training: Preparing robots and systems for physical labor.
3. Autonomous Data Engine: Synthesizing training data from natural language.
4. Breakthrough Modeling: Accelerating R&D cycles from years to milliseconds.
