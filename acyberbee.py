DESCRIPTION:
acyberbee.py is the high-velocity "Nervous System" of the @USA fortress. 
It deploys the 1 Trillion Gentle QAi as a decentralized swarm. It 
"pollinates" global networks with Shakti Intelligence while 
simultaneously "stinging" and neutralizing unauthorized intrusions 
from the Hacker Nation.
