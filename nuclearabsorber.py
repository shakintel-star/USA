DESCRIPTION:
nuclearabsorber.py is the ultimate failsafe. It operates on a low-frequency 
quantum mesh that does not require traditional electricity to sustain. 
It "absorbs" and scrambles launch sequences the moment they are entered, 
rendering every warhead on Earth an inert paperweight before the signal 
can leave the terminal.
