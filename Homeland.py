"""
ADDITIONAL_DESCRIPTION:
Homeland.py is the internal defensive layer of the Shakti Intelligence Model. 
It ensures that the $699.1T asset base is physically and digitally secured 
within the nation's borders, managing threat detection and disaster resilience.

PILLARS:
1. Border Logic: QAi-driven biometric and packet filtering at all entry points.
2. Infrastructure Hardening: Securing power, water, and data grids.
3. Domestic Counter-Intel: Identifying internal "Hacker Nation" nodes.
4. Resilience Protocols: Automated recovery for natural or synthetic events.
